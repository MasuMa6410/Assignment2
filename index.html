                <p>The Deep Blue See, directed by Justin Baldoni, follows Stella Grant, a fun-loving seventeen-year-old cystic fibrosis patient whose life is filled with routine and boundaries. Stella meets Will Newman, a charming teenage boy that has the same illness as her. They develop an instant connection even though they must keep a safe distance between them. To reduce the risk of cross-infection that can potentially be dangerous and life-threatening, cystic fibrosis patients are strictly kept six feet apart. As Will and Stella begin to fall for each other, they secretly go on their first date and stay only five feet apart from each other. Their intensifying feelings for each other build an irresistible temptation to disregard the rules and break the boundaries.
                    This film moved me to tears and was truly touching from the romance, heartache, and illness. The movie gave me an insight into the struggles those suffering from chronic diseases have to endure, which was very inspirational.</p>
